# Human Resource Machine solutions

[Human Resource Machine](http://tomorrowcorporation.com/humanresourcemachine) is a fun little dark-humoured puzzle game that either can teach you assembly from the ground up or allow you to put your existing assembly knowledge into challenging yourself in coming up with speed/size optimized solutions to ever-increasingly hard problems.

> Human Resource Machine is a puzzle game. In each level, your boss gives you a job. Automate it by programming your little office worker! If you succeed, you'll be promoted up to the next level for another year of work in the vast office building. Congratulations!

This repo contains the solutions I came up with, in a hope to exchange ideas to come up with the most size/speed optimized solutions (or simply to help those out there who are stuck). Even though the programs are created through drag-and-drop within the game, copy/paste from/to the clipboard works through assembly source code seen in this repo.

The file naming convention used is:

`<level>-<level name>[.size][.speed].asm`

Where `.size.` and `.speed` are used as modifiers to indicate whether the solution is deemed by the game as size and speed optimized.

For example, `07-Zero-Exterminator.size.speed.asm` means the solution is both size and speed optimized.
